# ChatterBox

ChatterBox is an AI-powered communication platform that allows users to chat with their friends in real-time, with AI-generated responses mimicking their friend's voice and personality. Using a short 10-second voice sample, the system clones the voice and stores embeddings for future use. Users can create personalized friend profiles, interact using voice or text, and receive responses generated by LLaMA 3.2, tailored to each friend's traits.
